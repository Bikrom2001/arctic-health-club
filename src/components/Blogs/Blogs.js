                                    ReactJS divides the UI into isolated reusable pieces of code known as components. React components work similarly to JavaScript functions as they accept arbitrary inputs called properties or props.At its very core, React basically maintains a tree for you. This tree is able to do efficient diff computations on the nodes.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Think of your HTML code as a tree. In fact, that is exactly how the browser treats your DOM (your rendered HTML on the browser). React allows you to effectively re-construct your DOM in JavaScript and push only those changes to the DOM which have actually occurred.
                                    </p>

                                        <strong>This is the second item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
